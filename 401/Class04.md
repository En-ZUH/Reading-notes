# Data Modeling

### 1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development.
 * Better program design, and higher code quality.
 * Creats a detailed specification.
 * Reduce debugging time.
***
### 2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
  * beforeEach() method needed to be called before the test running.
  * afterEach()  method needed to be called to rest the database after the test running.
***
### 3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development. 
 * slow process, means you need an extra time for straight forward implementations.
 * Not running frequently tests enough.
 * writing too large tests.
 * writing too large and insignificant tests.
***
### 4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
* The most important difference between ES6 (Classes) and (Constructor/Prototype Classes) Inheretence, is that classes define a type which can be instantiated at runtime, while the prototype itself is an object instance.
* The inheretence is much more effecient and simple with ES6 classes.
***
### 5. Why REST?

* Can be used well where network bandwidth is a constraint.
* Flexible
* Don't need to maintain a state of information from one request to another.
* Easy to Understand and Implement
* Good for caching a lot of requests.
* Caching is Easier with REST
* Much easier to code/implement for web services than SOAP.

|      Functional programming       |                           is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.                 |
| object-oriented programming (OOP) |      is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.       |
|              Classes              | template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics. |
|              `super`              |                                                                     The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.                                                                     |
|              `this`               |                        A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.                        |
|   Test Driven Development (TDD)   |                           Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed                           |
|               Jest                |                                                           Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.                                                           |
|    Continuous Integration (CI)    |                                                          is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day                                                           |
|               REST                |                                                         Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP.                                                         |
|            Data Model             |                     A data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another
